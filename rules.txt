-A program only does one thing and what it is must be clear
-Only use/create files when you have no choice (except for programs)
-A source code should :
	--make sense as reading it
	--be maximum 40 lines long
	--be maximum 70 characters wide
	--have an empty last line
-Program the least possible (don't overthink stuff)
-Hide the complexity of a source code outside the main function
-Hide the complexity of a program behind a meaningful name
