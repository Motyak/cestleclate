A program..
-only does one thing and what it is must be clear
-hide its complexity behind a meaningful name
-only use/create files when we have no choice (except for programs themselves)
-can be used in lot of ways, used along with others'


A code..
-hide its complexity outside of the main function
-makes sense as reading it
-'s purpose is easy to understand by looking at its main function
-doesn't need to be complicated or optimized

Format rules:
-Well indented > 36 lines long > 60 characters wide
	(Sometime it's impossible => priorities)
-Try making oneline functions (but only if it makes sense)

Code directory hierarchy :
<directory>
	'--<directories>	<---- libraries, 1 directory for each	//try not using any ofc
	'--c.cpp			<---- source code
	'--README.md		<---- readme file
[	'--<..>.h			<---- header file	] //try not using one if not necessary

Do a lot with only a few
'-> You can either "interpret" the code using 'cplusplus c.cpp' or
		you can compile it to a binary file using 'cplusplus c.cpp -o bin
