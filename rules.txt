A program..
-only does one thing and what it is must be clear
-hide its complexity behind a meaningful name
-only use/create files when we have no choice (except for programs themselves)
-can be used in lot of ways, used along with others'


A code..
-hide its complexity outside of the main function
-makes sense as reading it
-'s purpose is easy to understand by looking at its main function
-doesn't need to be complicated or optimized

Format rules:
-Well indented > 36 lines long > 60 characters wide
	(Sometime it's impossible => priorities)
-Try making oneline functions (but only if it makes sense)
