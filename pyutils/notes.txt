Improvements:

- Support for function returning nothing
- Support for function returning something other than string

  # assure we get a valid filename as output,
  # we have no collisions on outputs,
  # and we minimize input alteration

- make a package wrapper for I/O operations, and write unit test to
  assure it works as i would expect it to (if not, adapt the wrapper)

- Support for method (more generally, functions that take
  non-printable objects as parameters -- self arg)

- Support for keyword arguments (how to handle them in cache filename) 

- Add decorator argument to specify a number of days from which
  to clean the cache (e.g.: @USE_CACHING('1day')), we could store
  a hidden file containing the last time we cached each file in cache

- use pickle to serialize any object to text file and deserialize it
