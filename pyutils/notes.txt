Improvements:

- also replace '%' with hex value in the sanitize function,
  to prevent the following issue :
  "%2F" -> "%2F"
  "/"   -> "%2F"
  so instead we want :
  "%2F" -> "%252F"
  "/"   -> "%2F"

- Support for method (more generally, functions that take
  non-printable objects as parameters)

- Support for keyword arguments (how to handle them in cache filename) 

- Add decorator argument to specify a number of days from which
  to clean the cache (e.g.: @USE_CACHING('1day')), we could store
  a hidden file containing the last time we cached each file in cache
